## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### User Journey
1. **Land on homepage** → See compelling hero with value proposition
2. **Scroll to trial section** → Select genre/mood/duration
3. **Click "Generate Music"** → Backend creates anonymous request
4. **Wait 10-30 seconds** → Frontend polls status endpoint
5. **Preview generated track** → Audio player with waveform
6. **Click "Download"** → Redirected to signup page with track ID preserved

### Technical Features
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 5 generations per hour per IP address
- ✅ **Anonymous Support**: No authentication required for trial
- ✅ **Duration Limit**: 30-second max for free tier
- ✅ **Format Lock**: MP3 only for anonymous (WAV/STEMS require signup)
- ✅ **Client-side Quota Tracking**: localStorage prevents unnecessary API calls
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and retry logic
- ✅ **Loading States**: Clear UI feedback during generation

  "prompt": "optional description"
}

Response:
{
  "requestId": "123",
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Generation started. Poll status endpoint for updates.",
  "statusUrl": "/api/ai-music-requests/anonymous/music/123/status/"
}
```

### Check Generation Status
```bash
GET /api/ai-music-requests/anonymous/music/123/status/

Response (completed):
{
  "status": "completed",
  "track": {
    "id": "456",

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv/Scripts/activate on Windows

# Verify migration was applied
.venv/bin/python manage.py showmigrations ai_music_generation

# Start development server
.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver --skip-checks

# Test anonymous generation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai-music-requests/anonymous/generate/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"genre":"electronic","mood":"energetic","duration":30}'

# Test status endpoint (use requestId from above)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ai-music-requests/anonymous/music/1/status/
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Scroll to "Try It Right Now" section
# Select genre, mood, duration
# Click "Generate Music"
# Observe loading state → audio player
# Test download CTA (should redirect to /auth/register with track ID)
```

### Rate Limit Testing
```bash
# Make 5 requests rapidly
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai-music-requests/anonymous/generate/ \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"genre":"electronic","mood":"energetic","duration":30}'
  echo "\n"
done

# 6th request should return 429 Too Many Requests
```

## 📝 Notes

- Anonymous music generation uses a simplified flow (no user preferences, A/B testing, or RL)
- Real music generation depends on configured LLM providers in admin panel
- Audio storage URLs currently point to local storage - configure S3/GCS in production
- Consider adding CAPTCHA if bot traffic becomes an issue
- Monitor rate limit abuse and adjust throttling as needed
