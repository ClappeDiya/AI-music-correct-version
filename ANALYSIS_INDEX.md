## FAQ from Analysis

**Q: Is this architecture broken?**
A: Not broken, but fragmented. Each module works independently, but they fail to create a cohesive experience together.

**Q: Can I use it as-is?**
A: Yes, but users will experience disjointed compositions and frontend complexity.

**Q: How long will fixes take?**
A: 4-6 weeks for complete solution, can be phased over time.

**Q: What's the priority?**
A: Critical issues (1-5) first, which enable solving high-priority issues (6-10).

**Q: Can I fix individual modules?**
A: Yes, but you'll still have integration issues. A systemic approach is better.

**See ANALYSIS_README.md** for complete FAQ section.
