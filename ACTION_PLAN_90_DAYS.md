# 90-Day Action Plan: Music Generation Platform Strategy

**Created:** October 21, 2025
**Strategic Direction:** Developer Platform + Vertical Specialization
**Team Size:** Assuming 2-4 developers

---

## Strategic Direction Choice

Based on the comparison analysis, we recommend:

**PRIMARY:** **Path C - Developer Platform**
- Build best-in-class API for AI music generation
- Target: B2B developers building music apps
- Revenue: Recurring subscriptions

**SECONDARY:** **Path B - Vertical Specialization**
- Pick ONE vertical to dominate (recommendation: Game Music)
- Build deep integrations and specialized features
- Revenue: Higher-priced vertical-specific plans

**Why this combo:**
- Developer API provides stable recurring revenue
- Vertical provides proof points and case studies
- Both defensible against Suno/Udio (they focus on B2C)
- Plays to your strengths (orchestration, integration, features)

## Resource Allocation

### Development Team
**Option A: 2 Developers**
- Dev 1: Backend focus (API, stems, hybrid)
- Dev 2: Frontend focus (timeline, comparison UI)
- **Risk:** Slower progress, less parallel work

**Option B: 4 Developers (Recommended)**
- Dev 1: Backend API & infrastructure
- Dev 2: AI/ML integration & providers
- Dev 3: Frontend core features
- Dev 4: Vertical-specific features (game music)
- **Benefit:** Parallel work streams, faster shipping

### Budget Estimates

**Development Costs:**
- Team salaries: $40K-$80K/month (depending on size)
- Infrastructure (AWS/GCP): $2K-$5K/month
- AI provider costs: $1K-$3K/month (testing)
- Tools & services: $500/month

**Total Monthly Burn:** $45K-$90K

**Expected Revenue (Month 3):**
- API subscriptions: $2K-$5K MRR
- Game vertical: $1K-$3K MRR
- **Total:** $3K-$8K MRR

**Runway needed:** 6-12 months to profitability (assuming growth)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Stem Generation Not Available from Providers
**Mitigation:**
- Start with Suno (confirmed to have stems)
- Fall back to single-file for providers without stems
- Research open-source stem separation (Spleeter, Demucs)

### Risk 2: Developer Adoption Too Slow
**Mitigation:**
- Offer 3 months free for first 100 beta users
- Create video tutorials and demos
- Partner with AI influencers for promotion
- Consider affiliate/referral program

### Risk 3: Game Vertical Doesn't Resonate
**Mitigation:**
- Run user interviews with 10+ game devs before building
- Create landing page and gauge interest before coding
- Have backup vertical ready (meditation/wellness)

### Risk 4: Hybrid Generation Quality Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Mark as "experimental beta" feature
- Allow users to opt-in only
- Collect extensive feedback before wider release
- Have manual override for problematic combinations

### Risk 5: Provider API Changes Break Integration
**Mitigation:**
- Version provider integrations (v1, v2)
- Monitor provider status pages/announcements
- Build adapter pattern for easier swapping
- Have fallback providers configured

## Conclusion

This 90-day plan focuses on:

1. **Quick wins** (stems, comparison) to prove value
2. **Developer platform** for recurring revenue
3. **Game vertical** for differentiation
4. **Hybrid generation** for unique moat

**The goal is NOT to compete with Suno/Udio on model quality.**
**The goal IS to build what they won't: developer tools and vertical solutions.**

Execute this plan, measure ruthlessly, and adjust based on data.

**Let's build what Suno won't.**
