### Risk 1: Indian Users Don't Pay

**Indicators:**
- Conversion rate <3% after 1,000 signups
- High churn (>30%/month)

**Mitigation:**
- Lower pricing (₹99/mo Basic tier)
- Add more value to free tier to build habit
- Focus on ad-supported model instead
- Pivot to B2B (license to music apps)

**Fallback Plan:** If B2C doesn't work by Month 6, pivot to B2B API

---

### Risk 2: Authenticity Not Good Enough

**Indicators:**
- Authenticity score <3.5/5.0
- Users say "doesn't sound like Bollywood"
- Low engagement (users try once, don't come back)

**Mitigation:**
- Work closely with cultural consultant
- Beta test extensively before launch (100+ users)
- Iterate on prompts and parameters
- Consider fine-tuning model earlier (Month 4 instead of Month 9)
- Partner with Bollywood musicians for validation

**Fallback Plan:** If quality doesn't improve, license white-label from better provider

---

### Risk 3: Can't Get Telco Partnerships

**Indicators:**
- No response from telcos
- Meetings but no commitments

**Mitigation:**
- Don't depend on telcos for launch (nice-to-have, not must-have)
- Use influencer marketing as primary channel
- Build direct-to-consumer brand
- Offer telcos proof points (e.g., "We have 50K users, partner with us")

**Fallback Plan:** Focus 100% on organic growth and influencers

---

### Risk 4: Google Launches Competing Product

**Indicators:**
- Google Lyria announces India/Bollywood focus
- Free or aggressively priced

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (launch before they do)
- Build cultural moat (local partnerships they can't replicate)
- Focus on community and brand (not just tech)
- Add features Google won't (collaboration, education, wedding packages)

**Fallback Plan:** Position as "more authentic" and "built for India" vs generic Google
